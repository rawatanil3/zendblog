This is a question that has baffled scientists for centuries and the answer is, no one is really sure. Some believe that sleep gives the body a chance to recuperate from the day''s activities but in reality, the amount of energy saved by sleeping for even eight hours is miniscule - about 50 kCal, the same amount of energy in a piece of toast.\r\n\r\nWe have to sleep because it is essential to maintaining normal levels of cognitive skills such as speech, memory, innovative and flexible thinking. In other words, sleep plays a significant role in brain development.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen if we didn''t sleep?\r\nIrritable man	\r\n\r\nA good way to understand the role of sleep is to look at what would happen if we didn''t sleep. Lack of sleep has serious effects on our brain''s ability to function. If you''ve ever pulled an all-nighter, you''ll be familiar with the following after-effects: grumpiness, grogginess, irritability and forgetfulness. After just one night without sleep, concentration becomes more difficult and attention span shortens considerably.\r\n\r\nWith continued lack of sufficient sleep, the part of the brain that controls language, memory, planning and sense of time is severely affected, practically shutting down. In fact, 17 hours of sustained wakefulness leads to a decrease in performance equivalent to a blood alcohol level of 0.05% (two glasses of wine). This is the legal drink driving limit in the UK.\r\n\r\nResearch also shows that sleep-deprived individuals often have difficulty in responding to rapidly changing situations and making rational judgements. In real life situations, the consequences are grave and lack of sleep is said to have been be a contributory factor to a number of international disasters such as Exxon Valdez, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and the Challenger shuttle explosion.\r\n\r\nSleep deprivation not only has a major impact on cognitive functioning but also on emotional and physical health. Disorders such as sleep apnoea which result in excessive daytime sleepiness have been linked to stress and high blood pressure. Research has also suggested that sleep loss may increase the risk of obesity because chemicals and hormones that play a key role in controlling appetite and weight gain are released during sleep.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when we sleep?\r\nREM\r\n\r\nWhat happens every time we get a bit of shut eye? Sleep occurs in a recurring cycle of 90 to 110 minutes and is divided into two categories: non-REM (which is further split into four stages) and REM sleep.\r\n\r\nNon-REM sleep\r\n\r\nStage one: Light Sleep\r\n\r\nDuring the first stage of sleep, we''re half awake and half asleep. Our muscle activity slows down and slight twitching may occur. This is a period of light sleep, meaning we can be awakened easily at this stage.\r\n\r\nStage two: True Sleep\r\n\r\nWithin ten minutes of light sleep, we enter stage two, which lasts around 20 minutes. The breathing pattern and heart rate start to slow down. This period accounts for the largest part of human sleep.\r\n\r\nStages three and four: Deep Sleep\r\n\r\nDuring stage three, the brain begins to produce delta waves, a type of wave that is large (high amplitude) and slow (low frequency). Breathing and heart rate are at their lowest levels.\r\n\r\nStage four is characterised by rhythmic breathing and limited muscle activity. If we are awakened during deep sleep we do not adjust immediately and often feel groggy and disoriented for several minutes after waking up. Some children experience bed-wetting, night terrors, or sleepwalking during this stage.\r\nClosed eye	\r\n\r\nREM sleep\r\n\r\nThe first rapid eye movement (REM) period usually begins about 70 to 90 minutes after we fall asleep. We have around three to five REM episodes a night.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not conscious, the brain is very active - often more so than when we are awake. This is the period when most dreams occur. Our eyes dart around (hence the name), our breathing rate and blood pressure rise. However, our bodies are effectively paralysed, said to be nature''s way of preventing us from acting out our dreams.\r\n\r\nAfter REM sleep, the whole cycle begins again.\r\n\r\nHow much sleep is required?\r\n\r\nThere is no set amount of time that everyone needs to sleep, since it varies from person to person. Results from the sleep profiler indicate that people like to sleep anywhere between 5 and 11 hours, with the average being 7.75 hours.\r\n\r\nJim Horne from Loughborough University''s Sleep Research Centre has a simple answer though: "The amount of sleep we require is what we need not to be sleepy in the daytime."', '09:51 06 September 2013', '2013-09-06 08:51:00'),
(24, 'Why is sugar so addictive?', 'We all know how tempting it can be to have one too many chocolates or an extra slice of cake, even when we know it would be healthier not to. But what drives this craving for sweet treats?\r\n\r\nMany scientists suggest that we are primed to desire sugar at an instinctive level as it plays such a vital role in our survival. Our sense of taste has evolved to covet the molecules vital to life like salt, fat and sugar.\r\n\r\nLiz Bonnin puts sugar and sweetener to the test\r\n\r\nWhen we eat food, the simple sugar glucose is absorbed from the intestines into the bloodstream and distributed to all cells of the body.\r\n\r\nGlucose is particularly important to the brain as it provides the only source of fuel to the one hundred billion nerve cells called neurons.\r\n\r\nNeurons need a constant supply from the bloodstream as they don''t have the ability to store glucose themselves. As diabetics know, someone with low blood sugar can quickly lapse into a coma.\r\n\r\nBizarrely, scientists have found even just the taste of sugar can give our brains a boost. Tests have shown that participants who swill water sweetened by sugar around their mouths perform better on mental tasks than when they gargle artificially sweetened water.\r\nOur love/hate relationship with sugar\r\nContinue reading the main story	\r\nSix types of sugar\r\n\r\nShoppers can find calculating sugar content confusing, as it appears under many names on food labels. Most end in ''ose.''\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Glucose: Simple sugar that can be carried in the blood. One half of sucrose - table sugar\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Fructose: Simple sugar that occurs naturally in fruit. The other half of sucrose\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Sucrose: Commonly known as table sugar it occurs naturally in sugar cane or beets\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lactose: Milk sugar, which makes up just less than 5% of cow''s milk\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Maltose: Two joined-up glucose molecules\r\n\r\nâ€¢ High Fructose corn syrup: Corn syrup where half of the glucose has been converted into fructose. Chemically very similar to sucrose.\r\n\r\nOur tricky relationship with sugar starts at birth, as we are born with a sweet tooth.\r\n\r\nA recent study from Washington University, found that newborns have a distinct preference for sweet flavours over other flavours, while children enjoy sugary foods far more than adults.\r\n\r\nMany scientists believe a child''s preference for sweet things is an evolutionary hangover, as youngsters who preferred high-calorie foods in times gone by would have had a better chance of survival when food sources were unreliable.\r\n\r\nThe problem now is that refined sugar is too readily available and this could be part of the reason why childhood obesity rates have soared.\r\n\r\nHealthcare professionals now recommend that parents avoid giving babies sweet things to eat or drink to try to stop them developing a preference for them early in life.\r\nWhy do some people binge on sugar?\r\n\r\nEating too much sugar can lead to unhealthy eating patterns. Sugar can be a mood-booster as it prompts the body to release the ''happy hormone'' serotonin into the blood stream.\r\n\r\nThe instant ''lift'' we get from sugar is one of the reasons we turn to it at times of celebration or when we crave comfort and reward.\r\n\r\nHowever, the pleasant sugar rush triggers an increase in insulin as the body strives to bring blood glucose levels back to normal. This has the knock-on effect of causing a ''sugar crash'' and makes many crave yet more sugar, which can lead to a cycle of binge-eating.\r\nWe don''t know when enough is enough\r\n\r\nAdded to this, our bodies aren''t able to tell when we''ve had enough of certain types of sugar. Researchers have found that food and drinks sweetened with the simple sugar fructose do not trigger the same sense of fullness as other foods with similar calories.\r\n\r\nA study from Yale University found that while glucose suppressed the parts of the brain that make us want to eat; fructose did not. The test participants also reported feeling more satisfied after consuming glucose compared to fructose. Taken together these two aspects increase the risk of overeating.\r\n\r\nMany processed foods are excessively sweetened by sucrose, which contains 50% fructose. In fact you may be surprised by just how much sugar is hidden in common foods.\r\n\r\nSo next time you get caught with your hand in the cookie jar, at least you''ll know why.', '11:02 06 September 2013', '2013-09-06 10:03:00'),

It is now well below the stunning 10% average that the country has experienced for the last three decades. The pattern continues in the new headline figures which show GDP in the second quarter compared to what it was a year earlier. China''s National Bureau of Statistics has also published figures comparing with previous quarter. Confusingly that figure was slightly stronger than the one immediately before, but it does nonetheless confirm the pattern of slowdown over a slightly longer time frame. That figure showed growth of 1.7% in the second quarter, which would be about 7% if it continued for a whole year. China''s data are often criticised as unreliable. But it is abundantly clear the rest of the world will have to get used to China growing at a more moderate, and perhaps more sustainable pace.\r\n\r\nGrowth in investment in factories and other fixed assets also eased.\r\n\r\n"Further deceleration is possible if reforms and stimulus measures are delayed," said Alaistair Chan of Moody''s Analytics in a report.\r\n\r\nOther analysts say more stimulus measures will be essential if the government is to meet its growth targets.\r\n\r\n"We will see some targeted measures to stimulate growth,'''' said Credit Agricole CIB economist Dariusz Kowalczyk.\r\n\r\n"They have to do something.

I thought companies would carry on doing what they were doing, but look over their shoulder, in terms of their reputation," says Michael Devereux, a tax expert at Said Business School, University of Oxford.\r\nContinue reading the main story	\r\nCorporate tax avoidance\r\n\r\n    Locating factories, service and distribution hubs and regional HQs in low-tax jurisdictions\r\n    Starbucks, for example, sources its UK coffee from a wholesale trading subsidiary in Switzerland\r\n    And Google operates in Bermuda and Ireland\r\n    Transfer pricing is when a division of a multinational in one country charges a division in another country for a product or a service\r\n    This means artificially high charges can be levied internally, to siphon money from a high-tax country to a low-tax one\r\n\r\n    Corporation tax: Easy to avoid?\r\n    How do companies avoid their tax?\r\n\r\n"Starbucks appears to be saying they don''t think they owe any more money, but will pay anyway. If that''s true, it''s having a reputational effect - but it''s a bit odd in terms of the tax system, we wouldn''t want the tax system to be voluntary," he says.\r\n\r\nBranding experts agree the reputational side of things is key, as it is hard to measure the direct impact of tax shaming on sales and profit.\r\n\r\nDr Sue Bridgewater, a marketing expert at Warwick Business School, says if a company with a strong brand damages that, it also damages its financial "value".\r\n\r\n"Customers have very long memories and their emotional tie to a brand is a very important part of the loyalty," she says.\r\n\r\nBut Roper says even reputational damage is difficult to ascertain and can quickly dissipate.\r\n\r\nAnother impact of tax shaming is that individuals can boycott brands, but Roper says the number of people who take direct action is "relatively low".\r\n\r\nWhat is more dangerous for companies is social media, he says - citing #boycottstarbucks, which was formed in the wake of the Starbucks story - because "a small number of people [can] activate and ferment dissent among another group".\r\n\r\nBut is tax shaming justifiable?\r\n\r\nAmazon, Starbucks and Google are by no means unique in minimising their UK tax liability. And individuals often try to lower their own tax bill by exploiting rules in inheritance tax, or gifting to charity.\r\nContinue reading the main story	\r\nâ€œStart Quote\r\n\r\n    Is it remotely plausible that Google, Amazon and Starbucks would suddenly emigrate and stop trying to sell as much as possible to British consumers?â€\r\n\r\nimage of Robert Peston Robert Peston	Business editor\r\n\r\n    Read more from Robert\r\n    Is government too scared of multinationals?\r\n\r\nBridgewater says large multinational corporations have been using various methods of being "tax efficient" for decades, and it is "probably sound business practice".\r\n\r\n"The issue arises when we feel that a company has crossed a line and what it does to be tax efficient is morally, if not legally, inappropriate," she says.\r\n\r\nFor a lot of companies, it is about fairness, according to Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors.\r\n\r\n"It is very frustrating for many companies who pay large tax bills that some multinationals are able to avoid doing so.\r\n\r\n"The solution must be simplifying the tax system, not simply hectoring from Westminster. If these firms are immoral to take advantage of tax loopholes, then politicians are surely immoral for creating the loopholes in the first place. Taxes should be simpler to cut down on avoidance and relieve the burden our complex tax code puts on companies who do try to do the right thing," he says.\r\n\r\nThe director-general of the CBI, John Cridland, agrees the crux of the debate comes down to fairness.\r\n\r\n"A company may be making good revenues but pay lower amounts of tax for completely legitimate business reasons. But if it''s doing this by using so-called ''black-box'' arrangements, where transactions are designed for no commercial purpose at all, other than to avoid tax, then the CBI does not condone it, even if it is legal," he says.\r\n\r\nHe says if the government wants a different result from the tax system, it must change the rules.\r\n\r\nThe pressure to do so has rarely been greater.', '11:06 06 September 2013', '2013-09-06 10:06:50'),

The driver is not in jail but remains under court supervision.\r\n\r\nThe accident, which happened during the evening on 24 July near the Galician city of Santiago de Compostela, is one of the worst rail disasters in Spanish history.\r\n\r\nAll eight carriages of the train careered off the tracks into a concrete wall as they sped around the curve on the express route between Madrid and the port city of Ferrol on the Galician coast.\r\n\r\nSome 170 people were wounded in the crash.\r\n''Poor passengers''\r\n\r\nEl Pais newspaper obtained a recording of the phone call Mr Garzon made to activate the emergency protocol after the Alvia train smashed into the wall, caught fire, and derailed on 24 July.\r\n\r\n"There must be many injured, [the train] has turned over, I can''t get out of the cabin," he is heard telling a colleague at Madrid''s central station.\r\n\r\nDuring the conversation, Mr Garzon repeatedly says "poor passengers", adding: "I hope no-one has died."\r\n\r\nHe also admitted going too fast at the time of the crash.\r\n\r\n"I got distracted and I [was meant] to be going at 80, but I was going at 190," Mr Garzon said.\r\nWreckage of the train near Santiago de Compostela (27 July) The train was said to be travelling at more than twice the speed limit\r\n\r\n"I had already mentioned to the safety people that this [curve] was dangerous, that one day something like this could happen."\r\n\r\nJudicial authorities earlier said the train was travelling at 192km/h (119mph) on the bend where it derailed.\r\n\r\nCrash investigators opened the train''s "black-box" data recorder to find the cause of the crash.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, another recording has emerged of the driver''s pre-trial questioning, the BBC''s Tom Burridge, in Madrid, reports.\r\n\r\nIn the recording, Mr Garzon is heard giving evidence about a phone-call he received from a train conductor moments before the crash, in which they discussed which platform they would pull into.\r\n\r\nThe driver told the court he lost a sense of where the train was during the call. By the time he had engaged the train''s electric and pneumatic brakes, it was too late, Mr Garzon said.\r\n\r\nThe investigation into the crash will also consider why there was no automatic braking system on the curve in question, our correspondent reports.\r\n\r\nThe safety mechanism has since been installed at the scene of the accident.', '11:08 06 September 2013', '2013-09-06 10:08:26'),
